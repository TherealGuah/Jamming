OBJECTIVE
Remove from the search result the track that is passed is to the playlist and if a track is removed from the playlist return it to the top of the search list.
BACKGROUND 
When you press the + <button> and a new rack goes into the playlist you can’t clearly visualize what track moved into it. 

When you press the - <button> you visualize what track was it that was removed if you need to select it again.

This doesn’t allow you to order the tracks in a way that you would like to be displayed inside Spotify.
TECHNICAL DESIGN

Update the events of both <button>’s to include functionality that updates the state of both searchResults and playlistTracks.
CAVEATS


Potentially may cause the original state to not be able to update as intended  if both state changes are handled in one single event handler!
